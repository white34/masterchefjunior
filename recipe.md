Step1
To prepare Crust: combine Milk, Water, Salt, Sugar, and Yeast and stir well until dissolved. Allow to sit for 5 minutes until foam is formed on top as a result of yeast being activated. In a large mixing bowl or stand mixer sift the flour, add Yeats mixture and Oil and mix until a smooth dough is formed. Place in a bowl, cover and place in the fridge to rise (2-20 hours, “cold proofing”). Once ready to prepare pizza, punch down the dough, cut into 4 and form balls.

Step2
To prepare Pizza: dust a clean work surface with Cornmeal and Flour, using your hands or rolling pin roll out the dough to a 5-mm thick, place crust on a oven tray, spread 4-5 tbs Maggi Pizza Sauce over the crust, sprinkle with cheese and desired topping. Optionally sprinkle top with Oregano and Chili Flakes.

Step3
Bake the pizza in preheated oven, on the lowest rack at 240-c for 10-15 minutes until golden around the edges and the bottom.
